//primitive types : 
//1. Numbers: JS has one number type, represents both positive and negative numbers, whole numbers(integers), decimal numbers.
//2. String: sequence of characters. ex: hello, world.
//3. Boolean: true, false.
//4. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value or object. Example: let empty = null;
/* Primitive values are immutable (they cannot be changed).

They are compared by value, not by reference.

Unlike objects, primitives are not passed by reference */



/* Mathematical operations: +, -, *, %, /, **(power)  priority order: PEMDAS(parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) */

/* NaN: Not a number , is a numeric value that represents something that is not a number. 
    ex: 0/0 , 1 + NaN 
        NaN * NaN = NaN
*/

/* To check the type of something use (typeof) 
    ex: typeof 4 , output: number
        typeof 4.124343, output: number
        typeof NaN, output: number
